<p> Hello everyone. I mght not be able of submiting the code while I'm working on it, but I will keep you updated here. Now I'm just progrmamming the bastract class Figura, wich will be the abstract class for every figure in the application. How do I know the ist of vertices of a Java Polygon, the polygon has an arra  in itself wth this value, but the problem is that its size its larger so you can add vertices later. How does Java fill the rest of spaces in the  array when its done with the real vertices? If I found that or find a way of kwing the umber of vertices, I can draw the little squares in the corners of the figure.</p>

<p>I do not like the way they present the architecture of the program, I think is highly innefecient. Second, I think they gave us little tiem to get use to their architecture, and also, the new programming tools we are suposed to be learning. Of course, I kwow they have to be hard on us for us to learn, but deilvering the assigment with just one week of anticipation and also giving us just one week of working is bad decision making. Furthermore, my teacher is not that good, as he only repeats things from the book. He is nice, but he should, as my previous professor did, check what the want us to do in the assignment, and provide us with tools or ways to do those things.</p>

<p>Now I'm building the Tangram abstract class, they decide to keep the figures as a Java Collection. I must iterate over the Collection using the interface iterator, and draw the figures in each iteration. Easy but boring.</p>
