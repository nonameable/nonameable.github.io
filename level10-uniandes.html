<p> Hello everyone. I mght not be able of submiting the code while I'm working on it, but I will keep you updated here. Now I'm just progrmamming the bastract class Figura, wich will be the abstract class for every figure in the application. How do I know the ist of vertices of a Java Polygon, the polygon has an arra  in itself wth this value, but the problem is that its size its larger so you can add vertices later. How does Java fill the rest of spaces in the  array when its done with the real vertices? If I found that or find a way of kwing the umber of vertices, I can draw the little squares in the corners of the figure.</p>

<p>I do not like the way they present the architecture of the program, I think is highly innefecient. Second, I think they gave us little tiem to get use to their architecture, and also, the new programming tools we are suposed to be learning. Of course, I kwow they have to be hard on us for us to learn, but delivering the assigment with just one week of anticipation and also giving us just one week of working is bad decision making. Furthermore, my teacher is not that good, as he only repeats things from the book. He is nice, but he should, as my previous professor did, check what the want us to do in the assignment, and provide us with tools or ways to do those things.</p>

<p>Now I'm building the Tangram abstract class, they decide to keep the figures as a Java Collection. I must iterate over the Collection using the interface iterator, and draw the figures in each iteration. Easy but boring.</p>

<p> Ok, Now I've noticed they have implemented some classes for us, but in order to make new ones we have to check them out. It feels like cheating to me. I do not know If I'm learning or copying. The thing is, I cannot stop copying because I do not understand the architecture of the program. What a shitty way of doing things. I hope this is over soon. 

I think Java2D is a shit. It complicates a lot of things that are so easy in other languages. It's also nonintuitive. I try to overcome the nonintuitive nture of my programming assignments reading the code and seeing the variable and atribute names. The problems is that the names are not good. I hope this changes later, I wnat to build my own programs, with my own names, with my own architecture. </p>

<p>I have advanced a lot since the last entry. First, I understoodmre the architecture of the program as I read the full specifications - yes, my mistake-. Now I'm about to finish the abstract classes. Nevetheless, the poeple who made this should be dying of shame: I found an error in various Unit Tests! I need to get better at debugginhg, I'm not in the zone right now. Finally, I want to add that even with all the critics I have, I'm haveing a deep understanding of Inheritance and Interfaces. Now I'm wondering how could I do this in other languages whihc are not object-oriented? What about CPP, Python or even Lisp?</p>
