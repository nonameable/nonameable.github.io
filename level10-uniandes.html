<p> Hello everyone. I mght not be able of submiting the code while I'm working on it, but I will keep you updated here. Now I'm just progrmamming the abstract class Figura, which will be the abstract class for every figure in the application. How do I know the list of vertices of a Java Polygon? The polygon has an array as an atribute with this value, but the problem is that its size its larger so you can add vertices later. How does Java fill the rest of spaces in the  array when its done with the real vertices? If I found that or find a way of knowing the number of vertices, I can draw the little squares in the corners of the figure. If I run out of time, I will not do this, as its not really that important.</p>

<p>I do not like the way they present the architecture of the program, I think is highly innefecient. Second, I think they gave us little time to get use to their architecture, and also, the new programming tools we are suposed to be learning. Of course, I kwow they have to be hard on us for us to learn, but delivering the assigment with just one week of anticipation and also giving us just one week of working is bad decision making. Furthermore, my teacher is not that good, as he only repeats things from the book. He is nice, but he should, as my previous professor did, check what the want us to do in the assignment, and provide us with tools or ways to do those things.</p>

<p>Now I'm building the Tangram abstract class, they decide to keep the figures as a Java Collection. I must iterate over the Collection using the interface iterator, and draw the figures in each iteration. Easy but boring.</p>

<p> Ok, Now I've noticed they have implemented some classes for us, but in order to make new ones we have to check them out. It feels like cheating to me. I do not know If I'm learning or copying. The thing is, I cannot stop copying because I do not understand the architecture of the program. What a shitty way of doing things. I hope this is over soon.</p>p> 

<p>I think Java2D is a shit. It complicates a lot of things that are so easy in other languages. It's also nonintuitive. I try to overcome the nonintuitive nture of my programming assignments reading the code and seeing the variable and atribute names. The problems is that the names are not good. I hope this changes later, I wnat to build my own programs, with my own names, with my own architecture. </p>

<p>I have advanced a lot since the last entry. First, I understood more the architecture of the program as I read the full specifications - yes, my mistake-. Now I'm about to finish the abstract classes. Nevetheless, the people who made this should be dying of shame: I found an error in various Unit Tests! <br>
 I need to get better at debugging, I'm not in the zone right now. Finally, I want to add that even with all the critics I have, I'm having a deep understanding of Inheritance and Interfaces. Now I'm wondering how could I do this in other languages which are not object-oriented? What about Haskell, Python or even Lisp?</p>

<p>Ha!!!! I found another mistake in other Unit Test, but this one was huge! I only have two classes left and the interface will be on my hands <3</p>

<p>Ok, I/m finished with the Abstract classes. I know it took me a while but my mom told I had to dinner and then, help her clean the kitchen. I did not found any other mistakes, but I think two Unit Test are wrong. I'll check them tomorrow, after working on the Interface. It took me practically all day understand the topic and the architecture of the program. I think I worked 7 hours in total from the almost 12 it took me to finish the classes. That's a lot of innefiency! i think is because I don't feel in the zone. <br>
Seeing the interface I don't think its going to give a lot of work. Tomorrow I will tell you how it goes. Good night!
