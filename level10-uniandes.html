<p> Hello everyone. I mght not be able of submiting the code while I'm working on it, but I will keep you updated here. Now I'm just progrmamming the bastract class Figura, wich will be the abstract class for every figure in the application. How do I know the ist of vertices of a Java Polygon, the polygon has an arra  in itself wth this value, but the problem is that its size its larger so you can add vertices later. How does Java fill the rest of spaces in the  array when its done with the real vertices? If I found that or find a way of kwing the umber of vertices, I can draw the little squares in the corners of the figure.</p>
