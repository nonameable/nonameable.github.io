    <p>I'm making this website in order to develop skills and habilities in the process of constructing and maintaning a website.</p>
    <p>If you want to see any of my different proflies online, please check the links below: </p>

      <li><a href="http://nonameable.tumblr.com"> My Tumblr</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://github.com/nonameable">Github </a></li>
    </ul>
    <!--// here is where the talking begins -->

    <p> I don't know how long is this going to take me, but I'll acquire the compulsory habilities to do the Idea.
      I hope I can build something really cool here, only time will say what will happen. When I started College at the Unviersity of the Andes I felt like I was         missing something. I truly wanted to go to Harvard, or MIT or Berkeley but I wasn't able to. This, nonetheless, will not stop me. In fact, it will provide me       with more energy than anything else in this world.  </p>

    <p> <a href= "/acomplishments.html" >Here </a> you will find information about my learning process, how I'm developing ideas and finally, things to read for         fun. So, let's get started!</p>
