<p> Hello everyone, in this page I will tell you about my experience with Discrete Mathematics and Logic, two braches of Math that I really enjoy.</p>

<p>In this lab they ask me to prove or disprove some propositions about sets, let's look at them:</p>

<p>The first two are easy, not too complicated, but the thing is, I do not know how to wirte such things formally. I hope that the Teacher Assistant who will grade this assigment has a good heart. </p>

<p>Ok, I'm finished with the set proofs. Now I'm going to the relations part. It took me 10 minutes figure out the proofs. The rest of the time I was trasncribing the proof from my notebook to the word processor. I ned to learn LaTex , it seems pretty cool!</p>

<p>The relations and functions in the assignment were really easy. Again, it took me more to write them than to find them. I hate that waste of time. Is LaTex eficcient? </p>
