      <h2>Week 1 </h2>
      <p>This week I focused on The Odin Project and also how to use GitHub. Making this website has also taught me things. here is what  have done.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What is GitHub? How is it different from Google Code, SourceForge, BitBucket or save code on your USB/Local Computer?</li>
      <li>Why is it practical from projects, especially open source proyects? </li>
      <li>What to you need to install? What is Git?</li>
      <li>Github commands</li>
      <li>How does the Internet work?</li>
      <li>Servers, packages, requests and browsers</li>
      <li>Developer Tools in the browser; what is web scraping?</li>
      <li>How websites work. HTML basics</li>

    </ul>
    <p>As you can see, I'm just starting this. For next week I have the following topics in mind:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>TCP/IP</li>
    <li>How a Computer Work? </li>
    <li>Command line - basic commands with files</li>
    <li>Web jargon, vocabulary </li>
    <li>instalations</li>
    <li>What is Nitrous.io and why should I get it?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Week 2 </h2>
    <p>This week I was really busy and I ended up learning other things. I ended up learning a lot, and I think that is not bad, but I should stick to the curriculum</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>How a Computer Work?  <strong>check </strong></li>
	    <li>Command line - basic commands with files <strong>check </strong></li>
	    <li>Web jargon, vocbulary  <strong>check </strong></li>
	    <li>What is Nitrous.io and why should I get it? <strong>check </strong></li>
	    <li>learning about cloning with html and ssh.<strong>check </strong>  <br> I still have a question, do I have to choose one of them? its just that I apparently configure both</li>
	    <li>Homebrew, special folders in Mac and Linux. PATH and its danger, symlinks.<strong>check </strong></li>
	    <li>Various forms of installing ruby <strong>check </strong></li>
    <p> Apparently, installing it using brew doesn't change the version of ruby via the terminal; this is because in PATH the folder containint the default ruby is first I remember I used some kind of link to python3 to be able to use it via terminal. I will loook for that tomorrow. Anyway, it seems its better to install it using RVM or some github project, in order to be able to have multiple versions of it.</p>

    </ul>
