<h1 align = "center" > How I build a server in Java from Scratch</h1>

	<p>Sunday May 3, 2015</p> 
	<p> Hello all! 
	I don't know if you know about building servers with Java, but today I will write how to build one. I actually don't know either, so it's going to be really fun. 
	</p>
	<p>The requirements tell me I must create another package for the server. Let's do that.</p>
	<p> Update 18:12 / It seems like I have to build the interface and the "world" from scratb. The interface is really easy, but the world, well, that is another story. I practically copied the whole code from the other proyect. Now I have to understand how that code works.</p>
