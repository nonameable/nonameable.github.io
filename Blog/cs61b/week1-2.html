      <h2>Binary and Bits</h2>
      <p>Whenever numbers get too big weird things start to happen. Why? In this class we will consider the anomalies with integers. It turns out, each integer type in Java (and in other languages, of course), has a range of possible values.</p>

      <!-- insert image of the table -->
      <section id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/tableint.png"  height  = "240"  width = "400">
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </section>


      <p>How How are we supposed to handle Overflow? Simply, the minimum number is one less than the maximum number.</p>

      <p>He explains binary, and its operations. This in order to explain machine structures. Computers have chips with wires, which are determined by the capacity of the computer (8-bit, 32-bit , 64-bit). The example in the image melow is a chip that adds numbers, of course, in binary. The wires at the top and the bottom are input and the ones to the right are output. There is however, a problem with the maximum number we can add, case that is exemplified on the image to the right.</p>

      <!-- insert image of the chip adder -->
      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/chips.png"  height  = "240"  width = "300">
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p>As we might have expected, the sum in binary is performed int he same way as in decimal, carrying numebrs to the left. There is also a situation that might happen, and that is, when the result of an operation, in this case a sum, is bigger that the range of the numbers in the input. An example, in decimal, is 5 + 8, which yields 13, bigger (with more positions), than both 5 and 8. In this case, we do what is called truncating:</p>

      <!-- insert truncation image -->
      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/truncation.png"  height  = "260"  width = "350">
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      
      <p>We can truncate, which is pretty cool, but now we ask: how can we represent negative numbers? well, se the last part of the truncation image? The hint is: Given a number x, we define -x such that x + (-x) = 0. Have any idea of how can we do this?</p>
      <p>Well, let's try t understand with an example: We have the number 0101 in binary. Now what should we add to it so the result yields all zeros? Well, let's, think of an easier one: what should we add to it so the result yields all ones?</p>

      <p>
          0101 <br>
        + ???? <br> 
        _______ <br>

          1111 
      </p>

      <p> That is easy, it's just the opposite: <br>
          0101 <br>
        + 1010 <br> 
        _______ <br>

          1111
      </p>
      <p>Now note that, by trucantion, the concept we learned before, to turn 1111 to all zeros we just need to add one to it. Now we can answer the first question: <br>
          0101 <br>
        + ???? <br> 
        _______ <br>

          0000  <br>

      Well, in order to find ???? we just need to add one to 1010, which is 1011, an that is our (-x). This process is called <strong>Twos compelement</strong>   , and it simply indicates that to negate a number, we: <br>
      1. Flip the bits. <br>
      2. Add one. <br>

      </p>

      <p>In the image bellow, the 1011 might mean 11 or -5.Now I have a question: How does the chip knows when we mean 11 or 5. I don't know right now, but I know that <em>there is no need to change the hardware, as we are working in binary, it will yield the same result. It would do both unsigned and signed arithmetic.</em> </p>

      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/agnostic.png"  height  = "260"  width = "350">

      <h2>Minimums and Maximums and it's relation to Java</h2>

      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/minmax.png"  height  = "260"  width = "350">
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </div>

      <p>The image above shows the Minimums and maximums table for both US and S.</p>

      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/tableintjava.png"  height  = "260"  width = "350">
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p>The key thing to take into account is that in both US and S arithmetic once you get to the biggest number, it returns to the somallest one by truncation and in the case of S, also by Twos complement. <strong>This is the reason for some of the weird things happening in Java with big numbers, in this case, integers</strong>
      <br>
      Oh, so you don't believe me, try this: <br>
      System.out.println(2147483647); Result: 2147483647. <br>
      System.out.println(2147483647 + 1); Result: - 2147483648. <br>

      This works with bytes too! <br>
      System.out.println( (byte)  (127) ); Result: 127. <br>
      System.out.println((byte)  (127+ 1) ; Result: - 128. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Why are we taling all these things into consideration? Aren't these way too specfic, probably we'll never use it! Well, no! You need to be full stack, know when others don't. Why, because of <strong>bitwise operators!</strong> </p>

      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>

      <p>Finnaly, here are some other operations!</p>
      <div id = "explainshot">
        <table width=100% height=100%>
      <tr>
      <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
          <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/bitoper2.png"  height  = "260"  width = "350">
      </td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      </div>

      <p>By the way, the answer is 7.</p>
