      <h2>Binary and Bits</h2>
      <p>Whenever numbers get too big weird things start to happen. Why? In this class we will consider the anomalies with integers. It turns out, each integer type in Java (and in other languages, of course), has a range of possible values.</p>

        <table width=100% height=100%>

      <p>How How are we supposed to handle Overflow? Simply, the minimum number is one less than the maximum number.</p>

      <p>He explains binary, and its operations. This in order to explain machine structures. Computers have chips with wires, which are determined by the capacity of the computer (8-bit, 32-bit , 64-bit). The example in the image melow is a chip that adds numbers, of course, in binary. The wires at the top and the bottom are input and the ones to the right are output. There is however, a problem with the maximum number we can add, case that is exemplified on the image to the right.</p>
