      <h2>Arrays</h2>
      <p>
        I have already worked a lot with arrays, but just by seeing the slides I notice I don't know a lot.    
      </p>

      <p>We now that a variable is a name for a simple container, which can hold either a primitive or an object. We now there are 8 primitives and know I know there are two types of objects: an instance of a class or arrays! Yes, arrays are objects! (I should probably have discovered that as while finding that the length of the array is available using array.length, which is just an attribute of the class). </p>
      <p>
        Well, so waht is an array really? is a fixed integer: <em>length</em>, and is also a sequence of N simple container where N = length wehere all elements are the same tye of value.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three sifferent ways of instantiated with new: <br>
        y = new int[3]; // this fills the array with zeros, I did'nt know that. <br>

        int[] x = new int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; <br>
        int[] x = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6};   <br>

        Now, an example: <br>
        String[] s = new String [6]; // filled with null <br>

      </p>

      <p>
        You can use System.arraycopy()! This method thakes 5 paramenters: 
        <ol>
          <li>Source array</li>
          <li>Start position in source</li>
          <li>Target array</li>
          <li>Start position in target</li>
          <li>Number to copy</li>
        </ol>
      </p>


      <h2>Syntax for arrays of arrays, or what you taught were matrices</h2>
      <p>
        Wow, this blew my mind but it's true! What Have I been doing when I tell students to us an matrix of ints? Have I helped create a bunch of arrays of int arrays with jus values in position zero? Let's find out. <br>
        As an image explains more than 1000 words, here is one:

      </p>  

        <div id = "explainshot">
          <table width=100% height=100%>
          <tr>
            <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
            <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/arraybasics2.png"  height  = "240"  width = "300">
            </td>
          </tr>
          </table>
      </div>

      <p>
        Waht I would like to coment is that I must see the obvious: int[] []; just like Car [] is an array of cars, int[] [] is an array of int[], that means, <em> an array of int arrays</em>. Also, that this is just adresses, pointers to arrays. The matrix in the code above shows it. Finnaly, think about combining the syxtax, that is the last line of the ArrayBasics2 class in the image.


      </p>

      <p>
        Actually, this and an int matrix have no difference, its just that you don't think of the references when using the matrix. 
      </p>
      <h2>For loops</h2>
      <p>
        We have already sue a lot of for loops, but there are many ways of writing them. Here are four of them, and the last one is pretty hideous.
      </p>    

      <div id = "explainshot">
          <table width=100% height=100%>
          <tr>
            <td style = "text-align: center; vertical align: middle;">
            <img src="/Blog/cs61b/images/arraybasics2.png"  height  = "240"  width = "300">
            </td>
          </tr>
          </table>
      </div>
