        <p>I realized, after wasting much of time deciding what course to take and what to do to become a real programmer, and in the future a good developer, that I needed to stop thinking and replace my time investment with actully work. How to become better at coding? The anser is simple> code.</p>

        <p>The reason I started this blog was to prove myself that I could do better, that I could learn more things by myself that I learn at my University. This, however, is not wuite true. The pressure of a class is something that pushes ym limits and actually makes me do stuff. On the other hadn, doing thigns by myself requires discipline to subtitute the pressure that classes put on me naturally. That is why I must develop such pressure. How? I don't know yet, but I believe is a combination o things.</p>

        <p>The first thing is a goal. <strong>I want to be a programmer, a hacker, a developer, someone not afraid of challenges and hard work</strong>.
        This goal, however, is to broad, I must divide it into subtasks, more manageable, simpler to identify and follow. I have right now 20 days left of holidays. What I am going to do whith this 20 days is involve myslef commpletely into programming, by doing cs61B. NOt CS50, not web development, I need to get something done. I will watch the the lectures, do the homewoek and hopefully, I will advance as much as possible in the course. </p>

        <p> The next thing I need is placing some time to follow my goal: I will wake up every day at 7 Am, that means I'm going to bed as much as 11 Pm, and will program, follow lectures until is lunch time. No Tv, some breaks (not distracting) and with the only objective of program everyday. </p>

        <p>What am I going to do at the afternoon? I know I get tired after lunch, so I will read, change my activity, make some exercise. Then, I will write about what I did earlier in the morning and finally the goals for the night and the next day. At nights I will review what I learned, and solve the doubts, questions, everything I want to do make my learning more complete. I also thing I will watch lectures at night. </p>

        <p>There is a problem with all this. I still have other activities. How am I going to balance it? Well, giving up time for other stuff at other times. Getting to bed maximum at 12:00, waking up at 6:00. Let's do, and stop talking about it. </p>
