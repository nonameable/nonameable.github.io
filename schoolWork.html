	<p>Here you will find references to all my school proyects. Some are cool, some are not. Hope you like it. The langugage o preference in my school is Java, so please forgive me.</p>

	<p>I will be updating this site with the links to my projects as soon as I am able to upload it to github. The thing is, as the projects are asignments, I will have to wait until the final deadline fr delivering projects.</p

	<p>I'm curretly learning more about BitBucket, so if anyone is using it , I 'll uploadit there too.</p>
